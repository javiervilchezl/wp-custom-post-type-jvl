# WP Custom Post Type JVL

[**License MIT**](https://github.com/javiervilchezl/wp-custom-post-type-jvl/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Description

Plugin for Wordpress for the management of Custom Post Types (CPTs). You can add new CPTs, edit and delete them. It also has a personalized meta box for the contents of the CPTs (Additional Data) that you can use if you wish.

## Install

Download it compressed in zip, in your WordPress plugins panel select upload plugin, then activate it.
You will have a configuration menu for the plugin in your WordPress dashboard, with the name "CPTs Add/Edit".

## Setting

In the configuration menu you will have the plugin configuration menu where you can add, edit and delete your CPTs.

## Add new CPTs

You will have to fill out all the fields that will make your new CPT stand out from the others. Once the new CPT has been added, it will appear in your WordPress dashboard from which you can create new content for that CPT, view them, and manage the taxonomies (Categories, tags).

## Edit and Delete CPT

In the plugin configuration menu, where you can add new CPTs, you will see below a list where all the CPTs you have created will appear, with the options to edit and delete

### Edit CPTs

You can edit any CPT, but you have to keep a few things in mind, changing the slug of a CPT can negatively affect the SEO of your site if the URLs have been indexed by search engines, so it is preferable to have everything well thought out before create content in your new CPTs.

### Delete CPTs

You can remove any CPT, but you need to keep a few things in mind, removing a CPT whose URLs are indexed in search engines can cause SEO issues and you may have to do redirects.
In any case, if you want to delete a CPT, you will have the option to migrate the content you created to another CPT or to Wordpress's default POSTS and even assign it to another category.

>**Note**: If you do not want to keep the content of a CPT that you are going to delete, you must delete all its entries before deleting it and choose to migrate its content to any other CPT (since it has no content, no migration will be carried out)
